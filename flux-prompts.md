# Understanding Effective FLUX.1 Prompts

This note provides a breakdown of the key components of an effective FLUX.1 prompt, along with illustrative examples for each concept.

## Subject

The focal point of the image. Be specific. "A portrait of a woman" is too vague. "A close-up portrait of a middle-aged woman with curly red hair, green eyes, and freckles, wearing a blue silk blouse" is better.

Examples:

* A majestic Bengal tiger with vibrant orange fur
* A curious red fox exploring a misty autumn forest at dawn
* A translucent, iridescent, holographic sculpture of a lion with an ethereal glow of rainbow colors

## Style

The artistic approach or visual aesthetic you want. You can reference specific artists, art movements, or styles to guide FLUX.1.

Examples:

* Photorealistic
* Impressionist painting
* Art Deco
* In the style of Van Gogh

## Composition

How elements are arranged in the frame. Consider aspects like framing and perspective.

Examples:

* Wide shot
* Close-up
* Centered vertically and horizontally, taking up 1/3 of the space

## Lighting

The type and quality of light in the scene. Use terms like "soft sunlight" or "harsh overhead lighting".

Examples:

* Soft, dappled sunlight
* Dramatic lighting with strong shadows and highlights
* Soft, diffused light

## Color Palette

The dominant colors or color scheme. Don't assume the AI will infer colors, state them explicitly.

Examples:

* Warm tones
* Cool colors
* Purple and green color scheme

## Mood/Atmosphere

The emotional tone or ambiance of the image. Words like "eerie," "serene," or "futuristic" set the mood.

Examples:

* Serene and magical
* Powerful, regal, awe-inspiring
* Playful, whimsical, childlike

## Technical Details

Camera settings, perspective, or specific visual techniques. You can use photography terminology to give the AI direction.

Examples:

* Shot with a wide-angle lens (24mm) at f/1.8
* High ISO setting to capture the ambient light
* Shallow depth of field

## Additional Elements

Supporting details or background information. The more details you give, the better.

Examples:

* Exotic fish, glowing jellyfish, and intricate coral formations surrounding the mermaid
* Guards standing at attention, exotic animals like leopards and peacocks adding to the opulence
* Overlapping layers and slightly uneven edges to mimic the handcrafted look of a collage
